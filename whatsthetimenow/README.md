This retrieves the current system date and time, either as a local time or as a Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). 

Guide

The structure type tm holds the date and time in the form of a C structure having the following elements âˆ’

struct tm {
   int tm_sec;   // seconds of minutes from 0 to 61
   int tm_min;   // minutes of hour from 0 to 59
   int tm_hour;  // hours of day from 0 to 24
   int tm_mday;  // day of month from 1 to 31
   int tm_mon;   // month of year from 0 to 11
   int tm_year;  // year since 1900
   int tm_wday;  // days since sunday
   int tm_yday;  // days since January 1st
   int tm_isdst; // hours of daylight savings time
}
Following are the important functions, which we use while working with date and time in C or C++. All these functions are part of standard C and C++ library and you can check their detail using reference to C++ standard library given below.

Sr.No	Function & Purpose
1	
time_t time(time_t *time);

This returns the current calendar time of the system in number of seconds elapsed since January 1, 1970. If the system has no time, .1 is returned.

2	
char *ctime(const time_t *time);

This returns a pointer to a string of the form day month year hours:minutes:seconds year\n\0.

3	
struct tm *localtime(const time_t *time);

This returns a pointer to the tm structure representing local time.

4	
clock_t clock(void);

This returns a value that approximates the amount of time the calling program has been running. A value of .1 is returned if the time is not available.

5	
char * asctime ( const struct tm * time );

This returns a pointer to a string that contains the information stored in the structure pointed to by time converted into the form: day month date hours:minutes:seconds year\n\0

6	
struct tm *gmtime(const time_t *time);

This returns a pointer to the time in the form of a tm structure. The time is represented in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which is essentially Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).

7	
time_t mktime(struct tm *time);

This returns the calendar-time equivalent of the time found in the structure pointed to by time.

8	
double difftime ( time_t time2, time_t time1 );

This function calculates the difference in seconds between time1 and time2.

9	
size_t strftime();

This function can be used to format date and time in a specific format.
