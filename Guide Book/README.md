# Hola!

### My name's Hong Wei, and I'm an amatuer programmer right here. In this repo, I aim to compile what I have learn into different chapters and create a guidebook for all to enjoy and see.

1. Assignment and Operators
2. Conditional Operators
3. Inputs and Outputs	
4. If and ElseIf	
5. While Loops	
6. For Loops
7. Jump Statements	
8. Switch

10. Arrays
11. Pointers
12. Classes (I)

#### Cheers!
