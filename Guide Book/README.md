# Hola!

### My name's Hong Wei, and I'm an amatuer programmer right here. In this repo, I aim to compile what I have learn into different chapters and create a guidebook for all to enjoy and see.

### This will also serve as a reflection of my journey on C++ 

#### Below are the contents of my guidebook available at this time frame/period : 05/05/2018

1. Assignment and Operators
2. Conditional Operators
3. Inputs and Outputs	
4. If and ElseIf	
5. While Loops	
6. For Loops

#### Cheers!
