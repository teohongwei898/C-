!(5 == 5) // evaluates to false because the expression at its right (5 == 5) is true.
!(6 <= 4) // evaluates to true because (6 <= 4) would be false.
!true // evaluates to false
!false // evaluates to true. 

7==5 ? 4 : 3 // returns 3, since 7 is not equal to 5.
7==5+2 ? 4 : 3 // returns 4, since 7 is equal to 5+2.
5>3 ? a : b // returns the value of a, since 5 is greater than 3.
a>b ? a : b // returns whichever is greater, a or b. 

For example,

// conditional operator
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main ()
{
 int a,b,c;
 a=2;
 b=7;
 c = (a>b) ? a : b;
 cout << c;
 return
