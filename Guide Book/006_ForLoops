The for loop
Its format is:
for (initialization; condition; increase) statement;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's main function is to repeat statement while condition remains true, like the while loop. But in addition, the
for loop provides specific locations to contain an initialization statement and an increase statement. So this
loop is specially designed to perform a repetitive action with a counter which is initialized and increased on each
iteration.
-------------------------------------
It works in the following way:
1. initialization is executed. Generally it is an initial value setting for a counter variable. This is executed
only once.
2. condition is checked. If it is true the loop continues, otherwise the loop ends and statement is skipped
(not executed).
3. statement is executed. As usual, it can be either a single statement or a block enclosed in braces { }.
4. finally, whatever is specified in the increase field is executed and the loop gets back to step 2.
------------------------------------------------
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main ()
{
 for (int n=10; n>0; n--) {
 cout << n << ", ";
 }
 cout << "FIRE!\n";
 return 0;
}
