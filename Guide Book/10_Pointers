type * name;
where type is the data type of the value that the pointer is intended to point to. This type is not the type of the
pointer itself! but the type of the data the pointer points to. For example:
-------------------------
int * number;
char * character;
float * greatnumber;
-------------------
// my first pointer
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main ()
{
 int firstvalue, secondvalue;
 int * mypointer;
 mypointer = &firstvalue;   //address of 1st value equals to mypointer
 *mypointer = 10;           //pointer of mypointer = 10
 mypointer = &secondvalue;  //address of 2nd value equals to mypointer
 *mypointer = 20;
 cout << "firstvalue is " << firstvalue << endl;
 cout << "secondvalue is " << secondvalue << endl;
 return 0;
} 
---------------
firstvalue is 10
secondvalue is 20
