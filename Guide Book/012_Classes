A class is an expanded concept of a data structure: instead of holding only data, it can hold both data and
functions. 
--
Classes are generally declared using the keyword class, with the following format:
class class_name {
 access_specifier_1:
 member1;
 access_specifier_2:
 member2;
 ...
 } object_names; 
 
 ----------------
• Private members of a class are accessible only from within other members of the same class or from
their friends.
• Protected members are accessible from members of their same class and from their friends, but also
from members of their derived classes.
• Public members are accessible from anywhere where the object is visible.

// classes example
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class CRectangle {
 int x, y;
 public:
 void set_values (int,int);
 int area () {return (x*y);}
};
void CRectangle::set_values (int a, int b) {
 x = a;
 y = b;
}
int main () {
 CRectangle rect;
 rect.set_values (3,4);
 cout << "area: " << rect.area();
 return 0;
}
----------------
area: 12
