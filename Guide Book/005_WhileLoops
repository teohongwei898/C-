The while loop
Its format is:
while (expression) statement
and its functionality is simply to repeat statement while the condition set in expression is true.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main ()
{
 int n;
 cout << "Enter the starting number > ";
 cin >> n;
 while (n>0) {
 cout << n << ", ";
 --n;
 }
 cout << "FIRE!\n";
 return 0;
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the program starts the user is prompted to insert a number for the countdown. Then the while loop
begins, if the value entered by the user fulfills the condition n>0 (that n is greater than zero) the block that follows
the condition will be executed and repeated while the condition (n>0) remains being true.
The whole process of the previous program can be interpreted according to the following script (beginning in
main): 
1. User assigns a value to n
2. The while condition is checked (n>0). At this point there are two posibilities:
* condition is true: statement is executed (to step 3)
* condition is false: ignore statement and continue after it (to step 5)
3. Execute statement:
cout << n << ", ";
--n;
(prints the value of n on the screen and decreases n by 1)
4. End of block. Return automatically to step 2
5. Continue the program right after the block: print FIRE! and end program.
